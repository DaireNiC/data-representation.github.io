Write a program that asks the user to enter a positive integer and applies the following operation to it repeatedly until the sequence generated begins to repeat: if the number is odd multiply it by 3 and add 1, otherwise divide it by 2.

*Hint:* The Collatz conjecture states that, no matter the starting point, the number 1 will eventually be generated.
