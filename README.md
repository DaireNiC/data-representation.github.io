## Module description

A module in which students will investigate and operate the protocols, standards and architectures used in representing and querying the data that exists across the internet.
Students will also gain practical experience in developing applications that interact with such data.


## Lecturer

The lecturer of the module is [Ian McLoughlin (ianmcloughlin.github.io)](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io).
You can contact me at [ian.mcloughlin@gmit.ie](mailto:ian.mcloughlin@gmit.ie).


## Learning outcomes

On completion of this module the learner will be able to:

1. Explain the basic mechanisms by which data is transmitted around the web.
2. Compare the different data models and architectures used in modern web applications.
3. Design and utilise application programming interfaces in the context of the web.
4. Write software applications that adhere to the standards and protocols of the web.
