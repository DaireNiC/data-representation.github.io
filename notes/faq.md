#### Should I have one repository for each program?
In industry, it's generally best practice to have one application or library per repository.
However, in college, I would use one repository containing all my small programs when learning a language.
It seems more convenient, both for you and for anyone who wants to view your work in the future.

In general, you must ask yourself what is the purpose of the task at hand and make the decision on "many small projects versus one big project" based on that.
This is a key architectural decision that every software developer must make when embarking on a new assignment.

The only caveat I would add is to follow any instructions given in a problem sheet or project specification - they usually specify how to organise your code.


#### Where can I find the past exam papers?
